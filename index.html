        <p>I am a Bronx girly. I take The Bronx with me where ever I go.
            The first 5 years of my life I lived in the HighBridge area
            a couple blocks from Yankee Stadium. Close enough to hear the 
            roar of the crowd some nights. So it goes without saying which
            baseball team is my favorite. I enjoy watching as well as 
            participating in all different types of sports. Along with 
            Baseball, Basketball and Tennis are some of my Favorite.</p>

        <p>When I'm not attending a sporting event or watching a game, I am
            putting a good fit on and heading to a concert or out
            for drinks & food with family and friends. Traveling is one of many things I 
            love to do. Aside from all of that, I also enjoy beign comfy and lounging around the house.
